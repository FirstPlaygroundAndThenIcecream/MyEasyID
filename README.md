# MyEasyID
This is for the System Integration Course.
The task is to integrate a login form offered and hosted by the teacher to our own servers (two servers and a database should be created by using the technologies at our choices, in this case they are Python, Node.JS and MongoDB), both servers exchange information with the teacher's server to verify the identity of the user by using JWT, and allowing certain values to be displayed afterwards.
